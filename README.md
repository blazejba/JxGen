# JxGen: Generative AI with Jax

Welcome to JxGen, a comprehensive repository dedicated to implementing foundational Generative AI models from scratch using Jax.

## Work in progress
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)

## Backlog
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Autoregressive Models
- Normalizing Flows
- Energy-Based Models (EBMs)
- GFlowNets
